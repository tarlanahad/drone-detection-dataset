# Drone Detection Dataset

Welcome to the Drone Detection Dataset repository! This collection has been meticulously curated to provide a comprehensive dataset for drone detection tasks. Here you will find approximately 4,230 labeled images of drones sourced from two major datasets:

1. **Kaggle - Drone Dataset**: This set includes a diverse range of drone images that have been gathered and labeled for object detection. For more information and to download the data, visit [Kaggle Drone Dataset by Mehdi …zel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasmehdixtr/drone-dataset-uav).

2. **Mendeley - Drone Dataset**: A rich dataset from Mendeley that features labeled drone images suitable for various detection algorithms. For additional details and to access this dataset, go to [Mendeley Drone Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zcsj2g2m4c/4).

The datasets have been organized into two separate folders within this repository for your convenience:

- `Kaggle - Drone Dataset`
- `Mendeley - Drone Dataset`
